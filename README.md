Generating KPI report for a small coffee chain

I spend 15 years working in, running and then owning coffee shops. I felt exploring some coffee shop data would be a great start in data analysis.

This data is from a fictional New York coffee shop chain. I have been able to  take a look at it to produce some key metrics, and make compariasons by store, product
and employees.

Using the information generated using SQL, I have created a dashboard to visually explore this information clearly and concisely, in a format which would
give a business insight to key stakeholders.

In terms of the business, I would also look at some opportunities based on the data - 

Average Transaction Value (ATV) - this is at a steady level throughout the trading day in all stores. Even when transaction count dips around lunch time, this does not increase.
I would say this is due to the business not offering a lunch menu, so perhaps developing a range of sandwiches could increase ATV at this later in the day dip.

Mid-Month spike - Sales are noticeably lower at the start and end of the month, compared to the middle 10 days. This could be an opportunity to create special offers
or promote products around the start and end of the month, in order to drive more sales in these quieter times. Alternatively, this could be the best time to onboard new
starters.

Targets - The business targets are extremely low compared to what the stores are actually achieving. I would recommend raising these with SMART targets in mind.

Top Salesperson - Britanni, the top salesperson in the business works across all 3 stores. It could be an idea to speak with her, and encourage her to mentor 
some of the poorer performing staff members.

These are just a few ideas which could be taken from this data, but which could have tangible benefits for the business and help to move it forward.
